# Introduction to C++

This repository contain sample code base for putting together C++ code.

# Instructions for using the code samples

You may need to compile them if necessary. Check that you have the C++ compiler already installed.
Once that is done, you can try to compile to create an executable and then you can run the program

To compile the C++ file:

```
g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld.out
```

To run the generated compiled file:

```
./helloworld.out

# This would print "Hello World" to the console
```
